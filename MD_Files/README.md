### Day 1: Hello Automation

Create a Python script that prints "Hello, Automation!" to the console.

### Day 2: File Creation

Write a script that creates a new text file named "hello.txt" and writes "Hello, Python!" into it.

### Day 3: File Reading

Develop a function that reads and prints the contents of the "hello.txt" file.

### Day 4: File Appending

Modify the script to append a new line with "Python is powerful!" to the existing file.

### Day 5: List Files

Write a function that lists all files in the current directory.

### Day 6: File Copy

Create a script that copies the content of "hello.txt" to a new file named "hello_copy.txt".

### Day 7: Directory Creation

Develop a function that creates a new directory named "my_directory".

### Day 8: Move to Directory

Modify the script to move "hello.txt" and "hello_copy.txt" into the "my_directory".

### Day 9: Basic Web Scraping

Choose a simple website and write a script to fetch and print its HTML content using the `requests` library.

### Day 10: Parsing HTML

Integrate `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML fetched on Day 9 and print the title of the webpage.

### Day 11: Extract Links

Modify the script to extract and print all the links (href attributes) from the webpage.

### Day 12: Extract Images

Extend the script to extract and print all image sources (src attributes) from the webpage.

### Day 13: Download an Image

Use the `requests` library to download an image from the webpage to your local machine.

### Day 14: File Deletion

Write a function that deletes the "hello.txt" file.

### Day 15: Exception Handling

Enhance the script to include proper exception handling when performing file operations.

### Day 16: File Renaming

Develop a function to rename the "hello_copy.txt" file to "greetings.txt".

### Day 17: Read and Write JSON

Create a script that reads a JSON file, modifies its content, and writes it back to the file.

### Day 18: CSV File Operations

Write a script that reads a CSV file, adds a new row, and writes the updated data back to the file.

### Day 19: Zip and Unzip

Develop functions to zip and unzip files using the `zipfile` module.

### Day 20: Batch File Renaming

Write a script that renames all text files in the current directory to have a "prefix_" before their original names.

### Day 21: Calculate File Size

Create a function that calculates and prints the size of a given file.

### Day 22: Working with Dates

Write a script that prints the current date and time using the `datetime` module.

### Day 23: Date Formatting

Modify the script to print the current date and time in a specific format.

### Day 24: Basic File Operations with os.path

Explore the `os.path` module and implement basic file operations like joining paths and checking file existence.

### Day 25: File Permissions

Develop a script that prints the permissions (read, write, execute) of a specified file.

### Day 26: Directory Tree

Create a function that prints the directory tree structure of a given path.

### Day 27: Recursive File Search

Write a script that recursively searches for files with a specific extension in a directory.

### Day 28: Basic HTTP Request

Use the `requests` library to make a basic HTTP request to a public API and print the response.

### Day 29: JSON API Interaction

Extend the script to interact with a JSON-based API, fetch data, and print relevant information.
